# Sales-Tracking-and-Reporting-App
Developed a sales tracking and reporting application in Java as part of a university project.
The application allows users to record daily sales transactions, generate sale receipts, print day reports, and compare sales between two days. Implemented features include input validation, calculation of subtotals, taxes, and totals, as well as writing reports to a file.
Utilized object-oriented principles, array manipulation, and input/output operations to ensure accurate and efficient processing of sales data. Demonstrated strong proficiency in Java, problem-solving, and teamwork through collaboration on the project.
